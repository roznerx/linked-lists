# "Linked Lists Project" for The Odin Project 

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

## Notes [01/22/2024]:

- It's been a while! I'm currenly working as a Semi Senior (SsR) developer for a big company, yet I feel like finishing The Odin Project! Quite a titanic task, but worth the sweat.
- Not really a project but more of a practice for *Linked Lists*, which is part of the new "A Bit of Computer Science" section.
